On 28 July I went to the book launch for Teaching Lexically, written by Hugh Dellar and Andrew Walkley. The event took place at the pair's new language school, [London Language Lab](http://www.londonlanguagelab.com/about-us/). Naturally I took my camera along to the event and took a few snaps. Some of my shots were used by Delta Publishing on their [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/DeltaPubUK/posts/1200450449977298).
