A photo I took during Barbi's workshop in Slovenia earlier in the year was used on the website for the 1st International SKA-ELT Conference. SKA stands for Slovenská komora angličtinárov, which is the Slovak Chamber of English Teachers. The inaugural conference took place on 25 and 26 September 2015.
