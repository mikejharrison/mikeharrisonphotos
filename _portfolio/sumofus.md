An odd job request ended up in a morning's work at Unilever House near Blackfriars in London. The global consumer watchdog SumOfUs have been campaigning against TTIP[^1] – a proposed trade agreement between the European Union and the United States – and this was part of their action against the proposed deal in London back in May 2016.

My brief was to photograph the campaign manager with the advertising van and then the advertising van again as it drove past Unilever House – Unilever being one of the companies in favour of TTIP, which could itself be a danger to the environment, an area where Unilever has a defined pro-environmental image.

My photographs were primarily used by SumOfUs on their [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/SumOfUsOrg/photos/a.203331373086204.51638.181924628560212/1024247234327943/?type=3&theater). One photo appeared in a [PRWeek article](http://www.prweek.com/article/1394438/pressure-group-targets-unilever-employees-anti-ttip-billboard) covering the action.
