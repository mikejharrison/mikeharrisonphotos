The International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language holds its annual conference every year, usually in April. In 2014 the event took place in Harrogate in Yorkshire. I took photos during the Teacher Development Special Interest Group's event before the main conference on 1 April. One of my photos appeared in the newsletter to accompany a piece by Nina Jerončič.
